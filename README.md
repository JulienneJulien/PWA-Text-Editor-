## Description

>
>WHEN I open the text editor
>
>THEN I show that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
>
>WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
>
>THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
>
>WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
>
>THEN I explain how the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
>
>WHEN I load my web application
>
>THEN I should have, and can explain, the registered service worker using workbox
